System code too hot. Angrave 4/29/16. 
Draft v0.0002
 
This byte, that c char
malloc heap, that lstat mode
This byte for them POSIX calls
Them blockin' calls straight mutex locks
Schedulin', while I'm coding up in the city
Got threads on with that Lawrence
Gotta kiss my code it so pretty

Too hot (hot damn)
Called cond_wait and I don't need man
Too hot (hot damn)
Make a CPU wanna run a full speed fan

Too hot (hot damn)
Exec my code don't convoy my I/O
Too hot (hot damn)

am I bad bout that concurrency, deadlock down
mmap hit your address space (root!) x3
'cause sys code gonna exec to you x3

Saturday night and we in the lab
don't believe me just code (code on)
don't believe me just code uh
don't believe me just code x4

pass pass fail oh
stop, block a nanosec
Filled my heap put some variables in it
Smashed a stack, hash a coin
TCP, get the socket
Send to Harlem, Hollywood
getaddrinfo to port mississippi
if we SYN up, you SYN-ACK right back
smoother than a syn flood storm
Too hot (hot damn)

Called cond_wait and I don't need man
Too hot (hot damn)
Make a CPU wanna run a full speed fan
Too hot (hot damn)

Exec my code don't convoy my I/O
Too hot (hot damn)

Am I bad bout that concurrency, break it down
mmap hit your address space (root) 
'cause system code gonna exec it to you x3
mmap hit your address space (root) x3
cause system code gonna exec it to you x3
Saturday night and we in the lab
don't believe me just code (code on)
don't believe me just code uh

before we exit
let me mount a file system for you
Illinois sys funk you up x3
Illinois sys funk you up (huh)
I said system code compile you up 

Illinois sys 'pile you up
Illinois sys compile you up x3

Generate, deliver, handle that sig
If you sigint then handle it
If you fork then sig child it
Don't brag about it, come show me
Come on code
jump on it
If you really care then action it

Saturday night and we in the lab
don't believe me just code (code on)
don't believe me just code uh x3
don't believe me just code x2
pass, pass, pass oh!


Illinois sys compile you up
Illinois sys compile you up ('pile what?)

Illinois sys compile you up x3
Illinois sys compile you up ('pile what?)

Illinois sys compile you up x3
Illinois sys compile you up ('pile what?)

Illinois sys compile you up x3
Illinois sys compile you up ('pile what?)
Illinois sys compile you up
