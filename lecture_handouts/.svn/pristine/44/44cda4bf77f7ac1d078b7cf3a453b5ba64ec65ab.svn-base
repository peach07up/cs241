At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode

"A process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes."

"A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task"

"There is a set of waiting processes, such that P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, P2 is waiting for a resource held by P3 and so on until PN is waiting for a resource held by P1."

Mutual Exclusion. Hold and Wait. No pre-emption. Circular Wait (in WaitFor Graph)

Deadlock: A state in which no progress can be made. II A pdevice (process/thread//machine etc) waits for an event that will never arrive

while(writers) block. Later if writers>0 wake one up
while(writing || reading) block. (dont block on readers -otherwise deadlock).
Later broadcast to readers or signal to another writer

P1 grabs the chocolate! Arrow goes FROM the candy to P1
Wait for: From Px To the resource box
