We will start with a CDRom image
I used the 50MB image from DamnSmallLinux-
http://distro.ibiblio.org/damnsmall/current/

Install qemu (google...)
VirtualBox is another alternative

You will need an X11 display and enable X forwarding
(On OSX I installed Quartz; on Windows use cygwin)

Use xclock/xeyes to verify X11 can use your display

qemu-system-x86_64 -k en-us -cdrom dsl-4.4.10.iso


Note. I tested this with an Ubuntu VM as the host. It was slow because no hypervisor acceleration was available.
