The new slide format starts at Lecture 12, but I think I made improvements after that, so steal the theme from later ones.

It uses a free font.  Just download and install the three free weights from here:

..or email me (Brighten) and I'll send them to you.

Also, I've been using the font Monaco on the code snippets that I added (with syntax highlighting colors copied from TextMate).  I think Monaco is standard but I'm not sure.
